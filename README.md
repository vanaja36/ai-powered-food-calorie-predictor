# 🤖 AI-Powered Food Calorie Predictor  

An intelligent **AI/ML + Generative AI** project that predicts **food calories from images** using **Deep Learning and Computer Vision**.  
Built with **TensorFlow, Flask, and Python**, this project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can bridge the gap between **nutrition analysis and real-world automation**.  


## 🧠 Project Overview  
In today’s fast-paced world, tracking daily calorie intake can be difficult.  
This AI system provides a simple solution — **upload a food image**, and the model predicts its **approximate calorie count** using trained deep learning models and intelligent data mapping.  



## ✨ Key Highlights  
- 🍱 Upload an image of food and get calorie predictions instantly  
- 🧩 Deep Learning model trained using TensorFlow and Keras  
- ⚡ Integrated Flask backend for seamless model deployment  
- 🌐 Interactive and responsive web UI built with Bootstrap and JavaScript  
- 🧠 Designed as a real-world **AI + ML + GenAI** implementation  



## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

**AI / ML Frameworks:**  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- scikit-learn  
- NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV  

**Backend:**  
- Python (Flask)  

**Frontend:**  
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap  

**Tools & Platforms:**  
- VS Code  
- Git & GitHub  
- Optional: Google Colab / Jupyter for training  
- Deployment: Render / AWS / Hugging Face Spaces
